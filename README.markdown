# Android Market Scraper

The Android Market Scraper is a simple ruby script for scraping Google's
Android Market website.  Currently it outputs to CSV file format.  You
can change a few parameters at the bottom of the script (category,
number of pages to scrape, and free vs paid apps).

*IMPORTANT*: This project is now unmaintained.  Please see my new ruby gem: [market_bot](https://github.com/chadrem/market_bot "market_bot").
